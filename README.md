# SOP-ify üìùüìù
This lask web app that compares two `.docx` files and highlights changes in content and formatting. Designed to help user keep track of updates in SOPs, guides, and other documentation.

*(I had a documentation-focused internship opportunity during this time. Because of many difficulties I had in keeping track of the document versions and changes, I applied my programming skills to create more efficient systems. This reduces the time I need to manually search for changes.)*

## Features

- Upload and compare two Word documents
- Detect changes in text, additions, removals
- Detect formatting changes (e.g., bold, coloring, highlight)
- Real-time update detection using a file watcher

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

The backend is powered by Flask. It handles file uploads, processes `.docx` files using Python‚Äôs `python-docx` library, and compares the documents for both content and styling differences. The app continuously watches for changes in the files using `watchdog`, allowing for live updates.

The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can upload two files, and instantly see a list of changes. The page uses polling techniques to regularly check for changes in the background, providing a real-time comparison experience.

## What I Learned Through This Project:

- Develop a Flask app (with a Django background)
- Polling and long polling technique
- Keep track of local file changes
