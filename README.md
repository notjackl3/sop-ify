# SOP-ify üìù
A simple Flask web app that compares two `.docx` files and highlights changes in content and formatting. Designed to help teams keep track of updates in SOPs, guides, and other documentation.

## üöÄ Features

- Upload and compare two Word documents
- Detect changes in text, additions, removals
- Detect formatting changes (e.g., bold text)
- Real-time update detection using a file watcher
- Clean, user-friendly web interface

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
The backend is powered by Flask. It handles file uploads, processes `.docx` files using Python‚Äôs `python-docx` library, and compares the documents for both content and styling differences (like bold or italic text). The app continuously watches for changes in the uploaded files using `watchdog`, allowing for live updates.

The frontend is built with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can upload two files, click a "Compare" button, and instantly see a list of changes. The page uses JavaScript polling to regularly check for changes in the background, providing a real-time comparison experience.

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *wow I actually did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
